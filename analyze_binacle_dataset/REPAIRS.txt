## Use following script to analyze small files first:
## 1. pick a small file from list of broken files
##   $> (for x in `cat BROKEN_FILES.txt | grep "not repaired" | cut -f1 -d' ' | cut -f1 -d\.`; do name="sources/$x.Dockerfile"; wc -l $name; done) | sort -n
##
##  or from the original dataset (notice there is a lot of empty files and one-liners):
##   $> gedit sortedlist-dockerfiles.txt
##
## 2. run the following script to create dir for Dockerfile and run docker build on it
##   $> FILE=sources/484144517.Dockerfile
##   $> ID=$(basename $FILE | cut -f1 -d\.); mkdir -p $ID; (cd $ID; cp ../$FILE Dockerfile; docker build -t binacle:$ID . 2>&1 | tee log.txt)
##
## 3. to rerun a docker after updating Dockerfile (to diagnose)
##   $> docker build -t binacle:$ID . 2>&1 | tee log.txt
